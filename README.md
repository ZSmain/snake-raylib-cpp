# Retro Snake Game in C++ with Raylib

This project is a Retro Snake Game implemented in C++ using the Raylib game engine. It's a great starting point for those looking to dive into game development with C++ and Raylib.

This game was developed based on the tutorial available at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGqsnM_WEK4).

The game works with raylib version 4.5 and has been tested on Linux Debian 12.
